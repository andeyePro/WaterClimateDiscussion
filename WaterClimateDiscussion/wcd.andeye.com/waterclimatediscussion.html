    In previous years the Water Climate Discussion focused on incremental change that, with mass adoption, should reach tipping points. It is now looking likely that these will not be enough, so in 2024 we thought the unthinkable â€” Radical Change!

  Each roundtable discussion started with some ideas from our expert panelists, then we dove into the discussion:  Were the experts' suggestions too radical, not radical enough.  How could we make them work, or should we not even try?
</p><p>
  The main event featured six roundtable breakout groups chaired by ten experts, <a href="wcd2024.html">click here</a> to watch the main session & round table summaries, or you can <a href="2024/report.html">read the report here, dig into the roundtable whiteboard outputs or read the overviews.</a>

<p>The Water Climate Discussion series kicked off in 2021 with a set of five free online discussions held from May to September followed by a three-week interactive online conference in October.  You can watch any of these events again or read the summary reports and other outputs, via the links below.</p>
<p>Timed to help us reach consensus prior to COP26, the conference brought us together in a progressive series of workshops, small group discussions and 1:1 conversations, aiming to facilitate world-changing collaboration & action.</p>
<p>We brought our outputs to COP and joined with the COP26 Water Pavilion for their closing session, then came together again on 2 December to reflect on COP26 and determine our next steps:</p>
