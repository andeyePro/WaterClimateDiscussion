Please keep your pledge as brief and punchy as possible. Five or 10 seconds would be perfect and definitely no longer than 30 seconds. Please start your pledge with I'm, whatever your name is, and I pledge to do whatever you pledge to do. For example, my Cop 26 pledge was I'm Martin Curry, and I pledge to find better or ways for water professionals to collaborate online. I really need to update that. There's no need to say who you work with, but if you want to, let us know in the submission form and we can include your company or affiliation in an overlay like this. If you do want to include company logos or commercial content, please click the Sponsor button for more details. The highest quality way to provide your video would be to upload it. We can provide guidance on how to get the most out of whichever recording device you're using. If you're in a rush, the quickest way would be to record directly into this web page. If you change your mind later and want to see these options again, just reload this page. And if you've already been through this guidance, you can click one of the bottom two buttons appearing in front of me round about here to jump straight to the upload or web recording stage.","thumbnailUrl":["https://res.cloudinary.com/videoask/image/fetch/t_social-image-without-play-button-without-branding/https://media.videoask.com/transcoded/43014e8b-9fb5-4335-9c6c-6cfd426f576a/thumbnails/image.0000002.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/videoask/image/fetch/t_social-image-without-play-button-without-branding/https://media.videoask.com/transcoded/43014e8b-9fb5-4335-9c6c-6cfd426f576a/thumbnails/image.0000002.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/videoask/image/fetch/t_social-image-without-play-button-without-branding/https://media.videoask.com/transcoded/43014e8b-9fb5-4335-9c6c-6cfd426f576a/thumbnails/image.0000002.jpg"],"uploadDate":"2023-11-23T18:06:03.117934Z","contentUrl":"https://media.videoask.com/transcoded/43014e8b-9fb5-4335-9c6c-6cfd426f576a/video.mp4?token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJtZWRpYV9pZCI6IjQzMDE0ZThiLTlmYjUtNDMzNS05YzZjLTZjZmQ0MjZmNTc2YSIsImV4cCI6MTc1Mzk3NzIxM30.lm53prgHU1dpAG6bLUi7fteu666jf3KqEk3g_3LIUwaJnyawE0o8om8WdLEE5CDGXcw7BnJYrFfCsm_mwUYwUgi4xQTBs1kx-4lMSR2ZRSdoC57H-xKd32acMMP961Q5S7QpxRnMsumHiilibePk6CkUG-fU1QMyKtyMz9l0pjGW8z3XCbqy7_2zmwA4i4rwnfGjWNdkNbjpyqjfG-w5w3J_TE_Hf2F3-q8v81pcM4avpDrupOFERlgRYzJXrXnbKrDngpW4oRLuq_dnG-x39jVmOsPnaqrr87GkwEbVHEC7ZPEwuEWiAW1AVVxkuRq3jVMhW0rCTgrphlKPOzbzajL9SCcin3vRraUHKLa9ZRqnBFSzhOV1ZINgcSOV-EcXFndXOM-6AmXQSUO2a68I_k7ocu-ZBMK5jdseEF-dvZW3oFAx5I23dtIoPNhJ2UcNPrlewMgaHsEsGKn3xFVFmlrwuZOdY2YAUeuw5_uXBkwvJvxCmJs826qxaNtWoYX59Vm7VVMH4fGGYJAfDNTZOXR636Cgz5iO5fVe6qMh6GGIXT2nXlp3MxbDgd0IPXLdgeapniPVto1q_5J2oiqzcig6_K5F17VxYjeW8I0s7WBtyWVCaUA4WVZEjOcnUO5hQECMd4P-11g9Kn-P9JGIIbBDC9omMimCBM6eTL2KSDs","embedUrl":"https://video.andeye.com/fad2jv7zb"}</script><link href="oembed.html?url=https%3A//video.andeye.com/fad2jv7zb&amp;format=json" rel="alternate" title="WCD2023 oEmbed Profile" type="application/json+oembed"/><meta name="next-head-count" content="22"/><meta charSet="utf-8"/><meta content="notranslate" name="google"/><meta content="#111111" name="theme-color"/><meta content="#111111" name="msapplication-TileColor"/><meta content="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" name="referrer"/><link href="https://font.typeform.com/dist/font.css?ver=4.9.6" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/><noscript data-n-css=""></noscript><script defer="" nomodule="" src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-c67a75d1b6f99dc8.js"></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/webpack-78315e3aeb44fb7e.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/framework-ceaafd284653a06d.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/main-df84b927209038dc.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-b0de30bb8241cdab.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/2edb282b-1b4bf9d10bccd408.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/507-afaa117cd6adfa7d.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/265-122cbb07f75b0d41.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/722-28f94a4517e50a18.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/616-3dc20c9206d3af37.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/876-e5dd4043ea0da51b.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/393-fe28e027b1803ef3.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/chunks/pages/sharing/form-55c99ed12ec980cd.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/NSp3vQH1ja7E07Abbm5F6/_buildManifest.js" defer=""></script><script src="https://static.videoask.com/_next/static/NSp3vQH1ja7E07Abbm5F6/_ssgManifest.js" defer=""></script><style data-styled="" data-styled-version="5.3.9">.eDsbGH{-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-animation:fWWQhU 0.4s ease-out;animation:fWWQhU 0.4s ease-out;background-color:#004466;border:3px solid transparent;border-radius:50%;box-shadow:0 10px 30px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.21);color:#ffffff;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex-shrink:0;-ms-flex-negative:0;flex-shrink:0;height:160px;-webkit-box-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;justify-content:center;padding-top:10px;position:relative;width:160px;}/*!sc*/

Please keep your pledge as brief and punchy as possible. Five or 10 seconds would be perfect and definitely no longer than 30 seconds. Please start your pledge with I'm, whatever your name is, and I pledge to do whatever you pledge to do. For example, my Cop 26 pledge was I'm Martin Curry, and I pledge to find better or ways for water professionals to collaborate online. I really need to update that. There's no need to say who you work with, but if you want to, let us know in the submission form and we can include your company or affiliation in an overlay like this. If you do want to include company logos or commercial content, please click the Sponsor button for more details. The highest quality way to provide your video would be to upload it. We can provide guidance on how to get the most out of whichever recording device you're using. If you're in a rush, the quickest way would be to record directly into this web page. If you change your mind later and want to see these options again, just reload this page.

you so much for deciding to make a climate action pledge, and thanks to MWH's Treatment for funding this system and your video editing.

Please start your pledge with I'm, whatever your name is, and I pledge to do whatever you pledge to do. For example, my Cop 26 pledge was I'm Martin Curry, and I pledge to find better or ways for water professionals to collaborate online. I really need to update that. There's no need to say who you work with, but if you want to, let us know in the submission form and we can include your company or affiliation in an overlay like this. If you do want to include company logos or commercial content, please click the Sponsor button for more details. The highest quality way to provide your video would be to upload it.

I'm going to assume for now that you know how to use your camera app to record video and how to find that video to upload it. But if you have any problems, please email me.

I'm going to assume for now that you know how to use your camera app to record video and how to find that video to upload it. But if you have any problems, please email me. Most phones have a much better camera on the back than they do with a tiny little one on the front. But you can't see yourself while you're recording on the back camera.

Whichever UA you record, lighting is the most important thing for image quality. Window light is usually best as long as you're facing the light with the window in front of you, not behind of you, behind you, turning you to silhouette. But watch out if it's one of those days where the clouds are causing the light to rapidly change. If you can't wait for more steady indirect sunlight, it may be better closing the curtains and using room light. If you need to use room lighting, make sure it's actually making you brighter and not just your background. A light on the ceiling behind you is likely to put your face in shadow, whereas a desk lamp hitting a white wall in front of you bouncing back would look much better. Also, watch out for glare from computer screens in front of you, as that might reflect in your glasses or give you a nasty blue glow. You may want to turn down the brightness of your screen or enable a nightlight or blue light filter. Next up your position. It's best to adjust the distance between the camera and yourself so that we get a head and shoulders view of you something like this. Don't leave too much space above your head it should be above the center of the frame, but also try not to chop off the top of your head either. Be wise to check the background for anything that might be embarrassing, but please don't add artificial blur or fake background. These sometimes eat people's ears and can be distracting. Most contributors prefer to have bookshelves or their office in the background. A plain wall is fine too, or you can shoot outdoors if the weather permits and we can clearly hear everything you're saying. Yes, even more important than your video is how you sound. Try to record in a quiet spot with lots of soft furniture shings to minimize echo, otherwise might sound like you're in the bathroom to help with clarity and accessibility.

Whichever UA you record, lighting is the most important thing for image quality. Window light is usually best as long as you're facing the light with the window in front of you, not behind of you, behind you, turning you to silhouette. But watch out if it's one of those days where the clouds are causing the light to rapidly change. If you can't wait for more steady indirect sunlight, it may be better closing the curtains and using room light. If you need to use room lighting, make sure it's actually making you brighter and not just your background. A light on the ceiling behind you is likely to put your face in shadow, whereas a desk lamp hitting a white wall in front of you bouncing back would look much better. Also, watch out for glare from computer screens in front of you, as that might reflect in your glasses or give you a nasty blue glow. You may want to turn down the brightness of your screen or enable a nightlight or blue light filter. Next up your position. It's best to adjust the distance between the camera and yourself so that we get a head and shoulders view of you something like this. Don't leave too much space above your head it should be above the center of the frame, but also try not to chop off the top of your head either. Be wise to check the background for anything that might be embarrassing, but please don't add artificial blur or fake background. These sometimes eat people's ears and can be distracting. Most contributors prefer to have bookshelves or their office in the background. A plain wall is fine too, or you can shoot outdoors if the weather permits and we can clearly hear everything you're saying. Yes, even more important than your video is how you sound.

If you have plenty budget, you can use a teleprompter. We do have one in the studio somewhere, but I rarely ever use it. Instead, I have a laptop running the Andi PowerPoint template with the camera centered just above the script set as close to the top of the screen the script set as close to the top of the screen as I can. Feel free to click this link to download the Andi template by using an external micro phone. I have the camera around two and a half meters from me, and if I had the script at the bottom of the PowerPoint like this, you'd be able to easily see that I was reading. But if I keep the script at the top, it's hard to notice. I keep my script above the plus two. Two guideline In Andi's PowerPoint Template a post office telecom study concluded that the ideal voice should utter no more than 164 words per minute and pause for 00:40 8 seconds between sentences. I try to budget 140 words per minute.

are lots of ways you can use a script. If you have plenty budget, you can use a teleprompter. We do have one in the studio somewhere, but I rarely ever use it. Instead, I have a laptop running the Andi PowerPoint template with the camera centered just above the script set as close to the top of the screen the script set as close to the top of the screen as I can. Feel free to click this link to download the Andi template by using an external micro phone. I have the camera around two and a half meters from me, and if I had the script at the bottom of the PowerPoint like this, you'd be able to easily see that I was reading. But if I keep the script at the top, it's hard to notice. I keep my script above the plus two. Two guideline In Andi's PowerPoint Template a post office telecom study concluded that the ideal voice should utter no more than 164 words per minute and pause for 00:40 8 seconds between sentences. I try to budget 140 words per minute. So given that each video slot should be well under 60 seconds, you want to keep it well under 70 words, ideally under 20."}],"type":"poll","updated_at":"2023-11-23T15:11:34.308849Z"},{"allow_multiple_selection":false,"collect_contact_information":false,"created_at":"2023-10-24T15:45:52.640997Z","form_id":"9f01b7e7-b31d-49b2-8513-58977aa98a7c","gif":"https://media.videoask.com/transcoded/8c7ee1f5-6fb6-4ce3-99dd-7173eb5d6ea0/thumbnails/preview.gif","label":"10 Rather than holding your phone...

Good to hear you're up for a challenge. Actually, it's quite easy to use the rear camera on an iPhone with a recent Mac. Just Google use your iPhone as a webcam on Mac. We also have clients who use apps or do something similar with Android on iOS, mobiles or on Windows PCs. Or you could try putting together two mirrors at 45 degrees behind your phone. Please send me a photo of your setup if managed to get this working, or if you have plenty of time, you could set your phone up, then record yourself, review this recording, make any adjustments, and repeat until you're happy. Whichever technique you use, so that you can see what's recording you'll want to use. A tripod with a phone clamp or prop the phone up on a stable surface. Try to ensure that the phone's at eye level rather than looking up at you from a desk.

We also have clients who use apps or do something similar with Android on iOS, mobiles or on Windows PCs. Or you could try putting together two mirrors at 45 degrees behind your phone. Please send me a photo of your setup if managed to get this working, or if you have plenty of time, you could set your phone up, then record yourself, review this recording, make any adjustments, and repeat until you're happy. Whichever technique you use, so that you can see what's recording you'll want to use. A tripod with a phone clamp or prop the phone up on a stable surface.

If your webcam is on a large monitor on your desk, it should already be around the correct height. If using a laptop, you may need to prop it up with some sturdy books or an additional stand to bring your laptop camera to eye level. It's a great idea to use an external mouse on your leg to avoid touching the laptop or desk during the recording. Otherwise, your camera might bounce around. Please don't use online services like Zoom or teams to do your recording that'll degrade the video quality. If you're not sure how to record straight to your computer, we have a couple of brief video tutorials for Windows and macOS. When you come to record, please leave 5 seconds of silence before you start speaking, and 5 seconds at the end before you stop the recording. We'll edit these out for you.

webcam should be at eye level if possible. If your webcam is on a large monitor on your desk, it should already be around the correct height. If using a laptop, you may need to prop it up with some sturdy books or an additional stand to bring your laptop camera to eye level. It's a great idea to use an external mouse on your leg to avoid touching the laptop or desk during the recording. Otherwise, your camera might bounce around. Please don't use online services like Zoom or teams to do your recording that'll degrade the video quality. If you're not sure how to record straight to your computer, we have a couple of brief video tutorials for Windows and macOS. When you come to record, please leave 5 seconds of silence before you start speaking, and 5 seconds at the end before you stop the recording. We'll edit these out for you.

That's if Windows hasn't already selected the correct camera. Back in the Camera app, under the Video settings, please select the highest possible video quality available for camera. This will likely be 1080p or seven hundred and twenty p. One thousand and eighty p is better here. And if you get the option 25 frames per second, please select that. If you have more than one microphone for example, an external mic and a laptop mic, you need to check that the correct one is being used. Even if you think you only have one mic, I'd check anyway, so click Open Audio System Settings, and then under Input, select the correct mic. From the choose your Input device drop down. You'll need to close and reopen the Camera app for this change to effect. Then, once you're framed up and lit, well, start recording.

The most critical guidelines are for accessibility reasons. Firstly, please don't burn in subtitles. We'll add these separately. Feel free to send us subtitle files in WEBVTT format if you wish. Similarly, please don't add lower thirds or similar graphics. These can conflict with the subtitles and we can add them consistently. Please don't add any background music, as this can make the audio less clear. Music is also likely to be inconsistent with the rest of production and might give your video a commercial feel, which may be off putting to some viewers. Please provide files at 25 frames per second and at least 1080p in terms of audio, please normalize to peak at minus six decibels, if you know what that means, and it would be helpful to give us five second handles at the start and end. Of course, please don't go over the maximum time that we've set for the slot maximum, absolute maximum 30 seconds for a pledge, excluding the handles. And for the sake of consistency, it'd be good to include at least some head and shoulders piece to camera, like this monologue, ideally using a 90 mil full frame equivalent lens at f four, and bonus points for fully edited, non overlapping and client reviewed Web VTT subtitles.

happy to do the required editing for you, but if you have an in house editing team or want to edit yourself, there are a few guidelines that you need to follow. The most critical guidelines are for accessibility reasons. Firstly, please don't burn in subtitles. We'll add these separately. Feel free to send us subtitle files in WEBVTT format if you wish. Similarly, please don't add lower thirds or similar graphics. These can conflict with the subtitles and we can add them consistently. Please don't add any background music, as this can make the audio less clear. Music is also likely to be inconsistent with the rest of production and might give your video a commercial feel, which may be off putting to some viewers. Please provide files at 25 frames per second and at least 1080p in terms of audio, please normalize to peak at minus six decibels, if you know what that means, and it would be helpful to give us five second handles at the start and end. Of course, please don't go over the maximum time that we've set for the slot maximum, absolute maximum 30 seconds for a pledge, excluding the handles. And for the sake of consistency, it'd be good to include at least some head and shoulders piece to camera, like this monologue, ideally using a 90 mil full frame equivalent lens at f four, and bonus points for fully edited, non overlapping and client reviewed Web VTT subtitles.

If you have good bandwidth, please feel free to record and upload at your camera's highest resolution. That gives us most editing flexibility, but if your bandwidth is limited, you can record it 1080p. If you're able to set the frame rate for your camera, please set it to 25 frames per second and make sure you film in landscape horizontal orientation, as that's how we use it. You'll want to set up your camera at eye level on a sturdy tripod or other support. Usually I have my script on a laptop positioned so it's just fractionally below the bottom of the frame. I find that 90 mil full frame equivalent for head and shoulders. Shot like this works well to hide the fact that I'm currently using a script, but at that distance I'm around two and a half meters from the camera. An external microphone is essential. No problem if you don't have all this kit, just do the best you can with whatever you've got. Please leave 5 seconds of silence after you hit record and are settled in place, before you start speaking, and stay still for another 5 seconds at the end before you stop the recording. We'll edit these out for you. You don't need to edit your video at all before Uploading. We'll take care of that. But if you really want to do your own editing or have others do it, please see your editing guide first.

to hear that you can record your video on a dedicated camera, then upload it. If you have good bandwidth, please feel free to record and upload at your camera's highest resolution. That gives us most editing flexibility, but if your bandwidth is limited, you can record it 1080p. If you're able to set the frame rate for your camera, please set it to 25 frames per second and make sure you film in landscape horizontal orientation, as that's how we use it. You'll want to set up your camera at eye level on a sturdy tripod or other support. Usually I have my script on a laptop positioned so it's just fractionally below the bottom of the frame. I find that 90 mil full frame equivalent for head and shoulders. Shot like this works well to hide the fact that I'm currently using a script, but at that distance I'm around two and a half meters from the camera. An external microphone is essential. No problem if you don't have all this kit, just do the best you can with whatever you've got. Please leave 5 seconds of silence after you hit record and are settled in place, before you start speaking, and stay still for another 5 seconds at the end before you stop the recording. We'll edit these out for you. You don't need to edit your video at all before Uploading. We'll take care of that. But if you really want to do your own editing or have others do it, please see your editing guide first. I'm going to assume for now that you know how to use your camera to record a video and how to transfer it to your computer for Upload.

Lighting is the most important thing for image quality. Window light is usually best as long as you're facing the light with the window in front of you, not behind of you, behind you turning you to silhouette. But watch out if it's one of those days where the clouds are causing the light to rapidly change. If you can't wait for more steady indirect sunlight, it may be better closing the curtains and using room light. If you need to use room lighting, make sure it's actually making you brighter and not just your background. A light on the ceiling behind you is likely to put your face in shadow, whereas a desk lamp hitting a white wall in front of you bouncing back would look much better. Also, watch out for glare from computer screens in front of you, as that might reflect in your glasses or give you a nasty blue glow. You may want to turn down the brightness of your screen or enable a nightlight or blue light filter. Next up your position. It's best to adjust the distance between the camera and yourself so that we get a head and shoulders view of you, something like this. Don't leave too much space above your head. It should be above the center of the frame, but also try not to chop off the top of your head either. Be wise to check the background for anything that might be embarrassing, but please don't add artificial blur or fake background. These sometimes eat people's ears and can be distracting. Most contributors prefer to have bookshelves or their office in the background. A plain wall is fine too, or you can shoot outdoors if the weather permits and we can clearly hear everything you're saying. Yes, even more important than your video is how you sound. Try to record in a quiet spot with lots of soft furnishings to maintain. My eyes echo otherwise might sound like you're in the bathroom to help with clarity and accessibility.

UA you record. Lighting is the most important thing for image quality. Window light is usually best as long as you're facing the light with the window in front of you, not behind of you, behind you turning you to silhouette. But watch out if it's one of those days where the clouds are causing the light to rapidly change. If you can't wait for more steady indirect sunlight, it may be better closing the curtains and using room light. If you need to use room lighting, make sure it's actually making you brighter and not just your background. A light on the ceiling behind you is likely to put your face in shadow, whereas a desk lamp hitting a white wall in front of you bouncing back would look much better. Also, watch out for glare from computer screens in front of you, as that might reflect in your glasses or give you a nasty blue glow. You may want to turn down the brightness of your screen or enable a nightlight or blue light filter. Next up your position. It's best to adjust the distance between the camera and yourself so that we get a head and shoulders view of you, something like this. Don't leave too much space above your head. It should be above the center of the frame, but also try not to chop off the top of your head either. Be wise to check the background for anything that might be embarrassing, but please don't add artificial blur or fake background. These sometimes eat people's ears and can be distracting. Most contributors prefer to have bookshelves or their office in the background. A plain wall is fine too, or you can shoot outdoors if the weather permits and we can clearly hear everything you're saying. Yes, even more important than your video is how you sound. Try to record in a quiet spot with lots of soft furnishings to maintain. My eyes echo otherwise might sound like you're in the bathroom to help with clarity and accessibility. Please don't add any music and ask people around to keep the noise down while you record."}],"type":"poll","updated_at":"2023-11-23T18:06:03.111729Z"},{"allowed_answer_media_types":["video"],"collect_contact_information":false,"created_at":"2023-10-24T15:45:52.854803Z","form_id":"9f01b7e7-b31d-49b2-8513-58977aa98a7c","gif":"https://media.videoask.com/transcoded/477b1224-240d-49f2-9573-648ee3c3a1db/thumbnails/preview.gif","label":"19 Rather than holding your phone...

We want to open up this year's discussion to as many participants as possible. Naturally, that carries significant cost, so your support is immensely appreciated. Our intention is that anyone bringing a noncommercial climate action message can do so free of charge. So if you want to make a personal pledge without any logos or mention of companies, you don't need to become a sponsor unless you really want to. Also, if you work for a regulator or the public arm of a regulated water utility, then the chances are you aren't selling anything that your pledge could promote. So feel free to make your pledge without sponsorship. Don't worry, we'll get back to you if it comes across as an advert. We also want to make it as easy as possible for companies to share initiatives that help address the climate crisis. So we have four tiers of sponsorship that you can consider. Firstly, there's bronze. With this, we'll produce an electronic postcard with your logo that you can share on social media. We'll also repost an action pledge that you post on LinkedIn. We'll encourage you to make this video up to 30 seconds long, but you can go with a written pledge if you prefer. At the silver level, we'll embed up to three of your LinkedIn pledges on the Water Climate discussion website. We'll add a link to the page of your choice, and we'll repost one of your pledges on LinkedIn. And we'll also produce a Silver social media postcard with your logo for you to share. Next up is Gold. And the main feature here is that we'll edit up to three of your pledges into a color graded 90 seconds up to 90 seconds video, which we'll post on our LinkedIn page, along with a note of thanks. If you'd rather post this yourself, you can, but you'll have the option to repost the Water Climate Discussion post of your pledges. We'll embed this on our website and we can add another three of your pledges there if you like. Also, we'll add a Linked logo to the page of your choice. And of course, we'll produce a Gold social media postcard for you. And thanks to MWH's treatment for their Platinum sponsorship, it allows us to offer to edit pledges for water utilities and regulators and non commercial pledges for individuals at no cost to them using this innovative video submission system that you're currently using. So what does it cost? Well, Gold is one and a half thousand pounds, silver is 750 and Bronze is 375 pounds. All of these exclude VAT if applicable. And please get in touch if you'd like any further help, we can tailor any sponsorship package, dream up a unique precious metal package just for you if you really wanted Platinum. And we can come to you or arrange for a local net zero videographer to help you record. Thank you very

you very much for looking into sponsorship of the 2023 Water Climate Discussion. We want to open up this year's discussion to as many participants as possible. Naturally, that carries significant cost, so your support is immensely appreciated. Our intention is that anyone bringing a noncommercial climate action message can do so free of charge. So if you want to make a personal pledge without any logos or mention of companies, you don't need to become a sponsor unless you really want to. Also, if you work for a regulator or the public arm of a regulated water utility, then the chances are you aren't selling anything that your pledge could promote. So feel free to make your pledge without sponsorship. Don't worry, we'll get back to you if it comes across as an advert. We also want to make it as easy as possible for companies to share initiatives that help address the climate crisis. So we have four tiers of sponsorship that you can consider. Firstly, there's bronze. With this, we'll produce an electronic postcard with your logo that you can share on social media. We'll also repost an action pledge that you post on LinkedIn. We'll encourage you to make this video up to 30 seconds long, but you can go with a written pledge if you prefer. At the silver level, we'll embed up to three of your LinkedIn pledges on the Water Climate discussion website. We'll add a link to the page of your choice, and we'll repost one of your pledges on LinkedIn. And we'll also produce a Silver social media postcard with your logo for you to share. Next up is Gold. And the main feature here is that we'll edit up to three of your pledges into a color graded 90 seconds up to 90 seconds video, which we'll post on our LinkedIn page, along with a note of thanks. If you'd rather post this yourself, you can, but you'll have the option to repost the Water Climate Discussion post of your pledges. We'll embed this on our website and we can add another three of your pledges there if you like. Also, we'll add a Linked logo to the page of your choice. And of course, we'll produce a Gold social media postcard for you. And thanks to MWH's treatment for their Platinum sponsorship, it allows us to offer to edit pledges for water utilities and regulators and non commercial pledges for individuals at no cost to them using this innovative video submission system that you're currently using. So what does it cost? Well, Gold is one and a half thousand pounds, silver is 750 and Bronze is 375 pounds. All of these exclude VAT if applicable. And please get in touch if you'd like any further help, we can tailor any sponsorship package, dream up a unique precious metal package just for you if you really wanted Platinum. And we can come to you or arrange for a local net zero videographer to help you record. Thank you very much."}],"type":"poll","updated_at":"2023-11-23T14:23:46.881601Z","poll_options":[{"id":"e25224d3-d7f5-4a8e-b1e5-70b1819e6f87","option_id":"e25224d3-d7f5-4a8e-b1e5-70b1819e6f87","content":"Pledge

you so much for deciding to make a climate action pledge, and thanks to MWH's Treatment for funding this system and your video editing. Please keep your pledge as brief and punchy as possible. Five or 10 seconds would be perfect and definitely no longer than 30 seconds. Please start your pledge with I'm, whatever your name is, and I pledge to do whatever you pledge to do. For example, my Cop 26 pledge was I'm Martin Curry, and I pledge to find better or ways for water professionals to collaborate online. I really need to update that. There's no need to say who you work with, but if you want to, let us know in the submission form and we can include your company or affiliation in an overlay like this. If you do want to include company logos or commercial content, please click the Sponsor button for more details. The highest quality way to provide your video would be to upload it. We can provide guidance on how to get the most out of whichever recording device you're using. If you're in a rush, the quickest way would be to record directly into this web page. If you change your mind later and want to see these options again, just reload this page. And if you've already been through this guidance, you can click one of the bottom two buttons appearing in front of me round about here to jump straight to the upload or web recording stage.","thumbnailUrl":["https://res.cloudinary.com/videoask/image/fetch/t_social-image-without-play-button-without-branding/https://media.videoask.com/transcoded/43014e8b-9fb5-4335-9c6c-6cfd426f576a/thumbnails/image.0000002.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/videoask/image/fetch/t_social-image-without-play-button-without-branding/https://media.videoask.com/transcoded/43014e8b-9fb5-4335-9c6c-6cfd426f576a/thumbnails/image.0000002.jpg","https://res.cloudinary.com/videoask/image/fetch/t_social-image-without-play-button-without-branding/https://media.videoask.com/transcoded/43014e8b-9fb5-4335-9c6c-6cfd426f576a/thumbnails/image.0000002.jpg"],"uploadDate":"2023-11-23T18:06:03.117934Z","contentUrl":"https://media.videoask.com/transcoded/43014e8b-9fb5-4335-9c6c-6cfd426f576a/video.mp4?token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJtZWRpYV9pZCI6IjQzMDE0ZThiLTlmYjUtNDMzNS05YzZjLTZjZmQ0MjZmNTc2YSIsImV4cCI6MTc1Mzk3NzIxM30.lm53prgHU1dpAG6bLUi7fteu666jf3KqEk3g_3LIUwaJnyawE0o8om8WdLEE5CDGXcw7BnJYrFfCsm_mwUYwUgi4xQTBs1kx-4lMSR2ZRSdoC57H-xKd32acMMP961Q5S7QpxRnMsumHiilibePk6CkUG-fU1QMyKtyMz9l0pjGW8z3XCbqy7_2zmwA4i4rwnfGjWNdkNbjpyqjfG-w5w3J_TE_Hf2F3-q8v81pcM4avpDrupOFERlgRYzJXrXnbKrDngpW4oRLuq_dnG-x39jVmOsPnaqrr87GkwEbVHEC7ZPEwuEWiAW1AVVxkuRq3jVMhW0rCTgrphlKPOzbzajL9SCcin3vRraUHKLa9ZRqnBFSzhOV1ZINgcSOV-EcXFndXOM-6AmXQSUO2a68I_k7ocu-ZBMK5jdseEF-dvZW3oFAx5I23dtIoPNhJ2UcNPrlewMgaHsEsGKn3xFVFmlrwuZOdY2YAUeuw5_uXBkwvJvxCmJs826qxaNtWoYX59Vm7VVMH4fGGYJAfDNTZOXR636Cgz5iO5fVe6qMh6GGIXT2nXlp3MxbDgd0IPXLdgeapniPVto1q_5J2oiqzcig6_K5F17VxYjeW8I0s7WBtyWVCaUA4WVZEjOcnUO5hQECMd4P-11g9Kn-P9JGIIbBDC9omMimCBM6eTL2KSDs","embedUrl":"https://video.andeye.com/fad2jv7zb"}},"__N_SSP":true},"page":"/sharing/form","query":{"fullscreen":"","shareIdType":"f","shareIdValue":"ad2jv7zb"},"buildId":"NSp3vQH1ja7E07Abbm5F6","assetPrefix":"https://static.videoask.com","isFallback":false,"gssp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body>
