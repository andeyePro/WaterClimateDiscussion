    Join us for a post-mortem as we look back on ideas from the <a href="WaterClimateDiscussion-3.html">2024 Water Climate Discussion</a> and determine whether any of the proposed ideas could have truly made a difference.
</p>
<p>
    In 2024, leading water professionals convened to discuss potential radical changes that could be implemented, including <a href="#Moderators">reforming food systems, building sponge cities, reversing water cycles, implementing waterless sewage systems, improving household water management, and enforcing accountability for all polluters</a>. This online gathering brought together the brightest minds in the water sector to brainstorm whether and how such radical changes could be realized.

<h4 id="2044-News" class="mb-0 mt-3">7 November 2044 - Global Warming at 2.2°C:<br> Water Shortages and Flooding Threaten Major Cities</h4>
<p>
  London, UK – As the world officially reaches 2.2°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, many cities, including London, are grappling with severe water shortages. Despite a milder summer compared to previous years, London’s water system remains under strain. Reservoir levels in the Queen Mary Reservoir, one of the city’s largest, have fallen to 17% of capacity—its its lowest recorded level. Water rationing measures, introduced in August, are still in place, with household water usage restricted to 60% of normal levels, and these limits are expected to remain through winter. Thames Water has intensified groundwater abstraction and desalination efforts, but this has not fully compensated for the depletion of surface water sources.
</p><p>
  Across the UK, drought isn’t the only issue. Western England and Wales are dealing with severe flooding. Along the Severn and Wye rivers, high rainfall has caused major flood events in several towns. In Shrewsbury, the Severn breached its flood barriers again, leaving parts of the town centre under water. The historic waterfront is facing extensive damage, with several businesses forced to close as waters exceeded 6 metres. Further downstream in Tewkesbury, where the Severn meets the Avon, floodwaters have submerged homes and streets, leading to evacuations.
</p><p>
  On the Wye, Monmouth has been heavily impacted, with several areas cut off due to the rapid rise of floodwaters. The town’s floodplains have been overwhelmed, and emergency services are actively relocating residents from low-lying areas, where water levels continue to rise.
</p><p>
  Meanwhile, other European cities such as Madrid and Athens face their own water crises, with reservoirs across southern Europe dropping below critical thresholds. Despite measures such as expanded desalination and water recycling projects, these have been unable to fully offset the impact of prolonged dry seasons.
</p><p>
  In the United States, New York City is facing regular coastal flooding, with high tides and storm surges inundating lower Manhattan. Similar scenes are unfolding in Jakarta and Dhaka, where rising sea levels and recurrent flooding have displaced thousands.
</p><p>
  Despite ongoing efforts to adapt infrastructure, the escalating impacts of 2.2°C warming are becoming evident. “The strain on urban water systems and increased flood risks highlight the urgency of climate adaptation,” said Dr. Elara Voskel, a leading climate scientist. “We need faster global action to protect vulnerable populations from these escalating threats.”
